# [flatfeet](https://flatfeet.onrender.com) Background

This is the repo for my experimentation with the [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) libraries. I've used fast.ai to help build an image classifier (based on ResNet34) which can determine whether the arch of a foot is flat, normal, or high. The image classifier is about 63% accurate. It could be improved with a better quality data set than one pulled straight from Google Images.

The code is based on the wonderful work done by the fast.ai team. Review the Python Notebook [FlatFeet_Model_Development.ipynb](./FlatFeet_Model_Development.ipynb) for more details about the model.

The webapp is hosted on [Render](https://render.com)
