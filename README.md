# [Flatfeet](https://flatfeet.onrender.com) Background

This is the repo for my experimentation with the [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) libraries. I've used fast.ai to help build an image classifier which can determine whether the arch of a foot is flat, normal, or high. The webapp is hosted on [Render](https://render.com)

The code is based on the wonderful work done by the fast.ai team.

Email me @ rdevito@tepper.cmu.edu if you have any questions.
